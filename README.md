# VBA Stock Analysis

## Overview
The intent of this analysis project is to help Steve and his parents analyze stocks from 2017 and 2018 to find out what stocks are worth investing in.
We started off looking into one stock, "DQ", that turned out to not be a great investment. Now we are able to monitor twelve different stocks to find better ones to invest in. Once we achieved getting the VBA code to do what we wanted, we aimed to make it more efficient by refacrtoring it.
